Smart Neighbour Usage 

 

The Question 

 
As a group, the questions regarding being a ‘smart neighbour’ really piqued our interest. As a society, we are becoming increasingly distanced from those who live closest to us. If we were able to address this issue, the belief is that we would be able to build an increased sense of community within local neighbourhoods, which could ultimately lead to decreasing feelings of loneliness, increasing security and a general improvement in levels of happiness within residents.  

The Solution - Overview 

In order to encourage communication and collaboration between neighbours, we have developed the idea of “Smart Neighbour”, the app. This is an app that we would encourage all people to download. In order to catch people's attention when first launching the app, we would add a QR code in the doorway of apartment buildings which links to their app store where they are able to download the app. From there, the user would log in using their personal number and BankID. Once the user logs in, we will fetch their address information using an API and use this information to assign them to 3 levels of groups. 

The 3 levels of groups are based on location. The closest level will be your staircase – this will be your closest neighbours that live up the same staircase as you, varying from perhaps 5 to20 people. The next level will be your building – this will include all people within your staircase, and also extend to the rest of the building (for example Main Street 10A, 10B and 10C are all the same building with different staircases, so these would be linked together). Finally, it will be your local area. Cities will be split into different regions (of approximately 1 km²) and the one in which your building is located will be your region. 

The App – in detail 

The cornerstones of Smart Neighbour are availability, usability and simplicity.  

Within the app, we will have three selections once you reach the start screen. This is designed to make the app as simple to use as possible, so it is also friendly towards non-tech savvy users. The three sections are: 

Get Connected 

Within ‘Get Connected’, our aim is to encourage the level of communication and collaboration between neighbours. Here they are able to find out about, and post new events, read about local news, and offer/request help from one another. 

Within ‘Events’, users are able to post and view already existing events. When posting events, you are able to select which region you would like to offer this to – the staircase, the building or the neighbourhood. When viewing everything in the app, there is a button in the top left which opens a sidebar where users are able to filter everything based on the region they’d like to see. Users are then able to register their interest with the quick click of a button, or direct message the user who is hosting the event. Similarly, ‘Help Each Other’, we encourage the neighbours to use this page to request help from their neighbours, and for the neighbours to respond to the requests with a simple button. Again, we have links to direct message the user requesting help in order to get more info. Here you can also see that we have an ‘Add Post’ button that users can use to post new events/requests/etc. 

In the ‘Local News’ we will utilise an API to pull in the latest news from the local area, so this is targeted towards the regions within which each user lives. 

Sustainability 

Within sustainability we wanted to address another major current issue, while simultaneously encouraging connections between neighbours. Climate change is a very real and very urgent issue that needs to be addressed, and we believe that there is a willingness to embrace change within our daily lives in order to help make a change for the sake of our planet, but people don’t know where to begin and don’t have a platform that allows them to collaborate on this front. Here we offer our users three more options - ‘Carpool’, ‘Reuse’ and ‘Smart consumption’. 

Under ‘Carpool’, our users will be encouraged to offer the spare seats in their cars during their commutes/trips to their neighbours. They will be able to post a location where they will be driving from, the location they’ll be driving to, the time they will be leaving and the date of the journey. This will then be shown in a map format and allow others to see the route and get in touch if they would like to share a lift.  

Within ‘Reuse’ we give the users the opportunity to offer their unwanted items to their neighbours/local communities before they throw the item in the trash. This means that people will be able to give items a new life, reducing the number of products going to landfill every year. 

‘Smart consumption’ is a side where we also encourage neighbours to share items with one another that they may not have. For example, here you can ask if any of your neighbours have some tools that you’re able to borrow to do DIY. You can also offer items for others to borrow, for example if you have an item that you’re no longer using but don’t wish to give away permanently. This will reduce levels of over-consumption.  

Security 

The ‘Security’ section of our page is designed to increase feelings of safety within the community. We have three different options, ‘Neighbourhood watch’, ‘Incidents’ and ‘Weather alerts’. 

‘Neighbourhood watch’ is an area where users are able to organise their own neighbourhood watches. This includes going on walks to keep an eye on the neighbourhood, requesting your neighbours keep an eye on your house whilst you’re on holiday, or other similar activities. 

Under ‘incidents’ users are able to report incidents that have happened in the local area or building, for example if there is something wrong with the building, someone has accidentally crashed a car into another, etc. This has options for marking incidents as reported if they are things that the landlord needs to be aware of. 

‘Weather alerts’ utilises an API from SMHI to pull in the latest weather alerts in the region and would display these with information regarding the alert, and the map will display where the warning covers. 

Implementation 

In the beginning we will be implementing the app in a small area and targeting it at apartment blocks in order to capture the most people possible within the small area. If we are able to get it working and people buy into the idea within the small area, we would then scale up to cover all major towns and cities, and ultimately cover the all of the Nordic Countries. When dealing with houses rather than apartment blocks, the regions would need to be adjusted slightly in order to take into account the lower population density. This would be done using streets and areas instead staircases and buildings. 

In terms of marketing, we would have QR codes in the staircases for the participating buildings, alongside the usual marketing channels. 

Funding 

Customers would not initially be willing to pay for an app they have little knowledge of. We would therefore earn money by selling the app to the municipalities and also through offering local advertising on the app. The benefits for the municipalities will be that they are able to develop more inclusive and safer communities, while the local businesses would be able to advertise within the app safe in the knowledge that those seeing the advertisements are those who are living in the nearby vicinity. 

Future Development 

We also have a number of ideas for future development once the app takes off in order to make improve ease of usability: 

Search function – within Carpooling we would allow the ability to search trips based on destination, and within smart consumption & reuse we would allow users to search based on items 

Incidents – this could be tied in with the renting companies incident systems, meaning users are able to post directly into the app and the renting companies will be notified of what they need to do 

Reducing carbon footprint – introduce a points system to encourage apartment buidlings to sort their waste correctly and throw less in general waste. In return, they would get points based on performance and these points could then result in reduced rent (due to renting companies paying less for waste disposal) or other benefits if able to partner with local/national companies to sponsor the schemes 

Push notifications for new events/carpool journeys/etc 

 

Due to time and knowledge constraints, we have developed this app as a website, however if we were to go live with Smart Neighbour, we would intend to have both a website and app in order to catch as many users as possible.
